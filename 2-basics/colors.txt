Every(almost) shape is composed of an outline called stroke and what is inside it called fill
stroke(R, G, B); 
fill(R, G, B);
background(R, G, B);
strock/fill/background(sameNumber, sameNumber, sameNumber) === strock/fill/background(sameNumber)

strock and fill should be overrided otherwise the same values will be used for all of the remaining code
